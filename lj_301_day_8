Today's lab was good. I actually feel like for the first time I am being challenged with the concepts of the material. This is in reference to all of the methods of our labs, as well as all of the server configuration with node js and express... The lab on Tuesday was quite easy because most of the code was already set up, but I still felt like I didn't grasp the material. This is definitely one of those moments where I need to go back through the code of the lab and just read it through...

Also, I am super behind on my portfolio. I didn't even get to the assignment due today, as I was quite busy with extracurriculars after my lab... It is kind of a shame, but at the same time I will definitely be looking to do the extra credit at some point, so that is really just another opportunity to learn more:)
