Today I learned the importance of github, and how staying up to date is crucial! I felt like it was hard coordinating plans during the pair programming and bringing it together. We ran into roadblocks with our code and unfortunately it took a while to figure it out. It was frustrating how the plans for code changed, and were much more fluid.

All in all a tough last day to a challenging week! It's crazy to think this, but to think after how much time I put into these assignments every day and super tired I am now at the end of the week, but at the same time excited to learn more, and that is really encouraging. I am getting knocked down every once in a while, but I seem to be landing back on my feet, and that is a good feeling.
