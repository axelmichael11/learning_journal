Today I learned how complicated things can become in javascript, and sometimes your programs won't always become exactly how you want them to be... Its important to be really flexible and after just getting beat up, asking for help, I have learned a million ways how NOT to do something. I see it as being ok, and I am still not giving in, or getting discouraged. For how little I accomplished in code, conceptually I really grew in my understanding of arrays function and how to change their contents. (and how not to.... ugh!). From trying to create a "random array shuffler" function to a "no duplicator" function, (i loved the name for this one), which calculated a pure random array from an array of numbers... to a crazy while/for loop to try and do the same, I really took arrays and random probability to the limit. Although I have failed this lab miserably so far, I have learned a lot about splice, slice, concat, pop, push, indexOf, shift/unshift, sort, every methods part of the array package on MDN... Also! I felt like i grew in my research capabilities, and really took to the web to research the problem and try to pick out methods that might solve it.... overall a very unproductive day towards my work, but I learned a lot in the process.
