Today I learned how to do no duplicates on Monday's lab in my own way... That was really exciting, and I feel pretty accomplished with how much I struggled with this part... I am also learning to just keep powering through the material. Its more important to stay up on the day's activities rather than fall behind and get stuck endlessly. With this class test coming up over the weekend, I need to learn how to juggle my lab makeups and readings a little better, and definitely review CSS. I feel like so far CSS has been this extra subject, when really its just as important as other stuff... Overall so far so good.
