If I remember correctly,

this journal would have been right at the end of the cookie stand app... I ended up having to have resubmit the majority of this project, but I do remember learning how to keep the code going even when there was missing parts, right around when this journal was due... For instance I remember I hadn't generated a complete table of the cookie data on Tuesday... On Wednesday, I kept working on the form submission lab, and did everything that was possible until I figured out the lab from the day before. It taught me how to connect the pieces and parts of my code, and kept progress.. Which has to be an important part of development. Developers must run into problems on one part of an app, but keep progressing/developing other parts of it. Sitting around and scratching your head on one specific part isn't good, and it isn't productive. Usually by powering through and moving onto another task, the answer sometimes shows itself!!
