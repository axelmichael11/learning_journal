This was tough...

I felt like I had some tricks to check my code, but my efforts were futile in some parts...

I didn't understand exactly how to use the 'this' object... This lab isn't nearly as easy to interpret as ANY example in the readings or in class...

ALSO, no offense but I felt like the directions were kind of vague and unclear. It seemed like the directions were convoluted and I kept having to go back and forth to check my code was heading in the intended right direction...

I felt like I gained ground, but there were clear unknowns on how to APPROACH the problem... I know exactly what is the problem but I feel like we haven't come close to something like this in the past, or even in class today...

I respect how much this lab encompassed. It really culminated what we have learned so far and I am curious to how the code review will go tomorrow...

I feel like I am playing serious catch up at some point... I don't ask too many questions about the actual code, but I am curious as to how I compare to the class. Just feel like its hard to compare how my code stacks up to what is expected... hmm
