Journal for April 28

This journal was referring to Thursday's work... By this day we had most functionality working, and especially the workflow to everyone's part. It really came together nicely, everyone adding their part to the project... By the end of the day we were just working on the CSS... Although we had work to be done by the end of the night pretty late, it was a good idea to at least start the CSS together to get everyone's sense of what the web app should look like...
