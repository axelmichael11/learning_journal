Journal Entry due April 26...

This was due on Thursday, so I learned a ton on Wednesday... We pretty much had to restructure our project on Wednesday and by the end of that day we had most problems resolved. I felt like this day we really got the ball rolling with keeping our merge conflicts clean and easy fixes... I was so proud of our team this day, we really overcame a lot of moving parts, between merge conflicts and coming up with bugs with certain product features, I was really proud with what we did by Thursday!
