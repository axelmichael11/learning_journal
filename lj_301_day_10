**May 20 2017**

This journal was for yesterday, Friday May 19... But as far as yesterday goes, I definitely ended on a high note. Made up a lot of work I had yet to complete for my portfolio, and powered through labs with all of my partners. I felt like most days it took both of us to really grasp where concepts were coming from, as most of the code is already written so I felt like most of the time is just figuring out where the code is headed.

I actually would say that yesterday, or Friday's lab was probably my favorite yet at Code Fellows! I am fascinated with data cleaning and organizing data for the steps to be manipulated and deriving conclusions from the data, so using map(), filter() and reduce() was awesome to see how javascript goes about the early steps in managing data.
