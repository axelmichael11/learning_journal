# LJ Code 301 - Day 1 #

Today was good. Well it was really long... I fell behind this week a little bit but it was really due to things outside of CodeFellows... Such is life! This week I have definitely learned to time manage, and to adapt. It was amazing how little code we actually had to right this week yet I had one of my most frustrating days at code fellows yet! Its all good, I am trying to learn from my mistakes and I want to push it into next week as a better student and developer... I remember Sam mentioned something really wise with regards to this stuff, which he stated something like we are bound to get stuck, its really just a matter of how one responds to being stuck for hours... Changing the approach, adapting to new material quickly and testing it out! Especially now that we are using jQuery and multiple frameworks, I am really just learning how to be adaptive and learning how to learn. It is a long process but I feel like I am improving, which is really a good feeling. It is a weird feeling to look back at something I was "banging my head against the wall" over on Wednesday, and to revisit it today and think that wasn't too bad. It really is just a matter of experience. I did struggle this week but I was also proud of what I accomplished on my own and with my partners... I guess it is all part of the journey as a developer! I am excited!
