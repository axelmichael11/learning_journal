Today was good. I have been doing a good amount of makeup work concerning my portfolio is concerned, which is helping my conceptual understanding of the labs much easier to understand. Just a lot of moving parts in all of our labs... While I am going back through each of our labs, we learn something and then get rid of it and do it another way, which can be hard to solidify each process, but surely I will have most of it figured out. Right now I am just trying to make my portfolio awesome. I feel like I have been super busy this past week and a half outside of Code Fellows and I have just been doing the portfolio assignments to meet the requirements, but I am always left with more cool new things I want to complete! I really want to ramp up things by the end of the week.....
