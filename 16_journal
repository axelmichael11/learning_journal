This is the learning journal due April 26...

This was due Wednesday April 26, so concerning Tuesday of project week, I learned how important it is to have effective communication... I feel like the nature of software in a team environment can be talked about for days, but when the code is actually worked through the real problems become visible. Tuesday we ran into local storage issues and at this point in the project week it became crucial to maintain effective communication, that is what I learned most from Tuesday.
