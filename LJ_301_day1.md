Today I learned how to use the media kit based on the page size... It was a great introduction to collapsing the page in order to fit the elements on the page... I also learned how nice page breaks can easily do multiple parts at the same time, which is really convenient for multiple screen sizes...

For instance! In our lab we had to add the hamburger menu and at the same time hide the nav bar... and vice versa, depending on minimum page width... I found that really convenient!

I am looking to implement some of the shayhowe documentation in the future... I remember we have used this same site for other animation doc and I really really like this documentation... Clearly lays out documentation to lay a solid introduction to the subject... Of course this is no MDN :)... Looking for cool new page break tricks in the future!
