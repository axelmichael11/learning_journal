Journal Entry for April 22

This was the last day of class before project week...

If I remember correctly, I had learned the power of jquery and css animations this day... it was really cool to see just how quickly awesome animation and search engines can be made using javascript and css! I really liked how the class examples were being done in the console... I liked how casual the experience was, and how we could see the effects in real time... Also by this time I hadn't finished busmall app, so I was having breakthroughs with the non-duplicates and trying to do it in a unique way!
