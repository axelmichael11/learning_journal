Learning Journal for day 15

This was the last day of class before project week if I remember correctly... I remember things were going really smoothly. We had just been assigned our groups and I was really excited to create something cool! Although by this day we didn't have our project idea figured out I really liked the ideas we had to do! Also, we had just talked about the test and so that was a something that I knew I had to back over the material and study before trying... The test ended up relatively fine so that was good in the end. As my last journal entry, at this point I was definitely excited to start 401 javascript. I felt like 301 introduced a lot of new concepts and ideas, and I really want to take a deeper dive into the material on my own at this point! Thanks for great class Sam! Cheers.
