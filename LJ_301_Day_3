Honestly yesterday didn't go so hot... Me and my partner worked incredibly well together which was amazing, as we both were just exploring different possible solutions to the problem but neither of us could arrive to the solution, as the problem was a really reallyyyy dense line of code we were trying to shell out using jQuery, and we simply had never seen the syntax needed to complete the problem...

It was pretty frustrating that we had no idea on where to start, as the subject was not mentioned in class once. Yes we had a resource that mentioned this but it didn't explicitly say it on the resource. Because this was a solution more on the syntax of jquery rather than coming up with a function, we were simply searching endlessly in docs in the wrong direction.
